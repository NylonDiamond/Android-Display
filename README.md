**Null keyboard**

If you don't want the keyboard to show on your screen while mirroring, Download "Null Input Method" from here: https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.apedroid.hwkeyboardhelperfree&hl=en_US . My script will switch your phone's keyboard to "Null Input Method" if you have it installed and you have the "Use Null keyboard" setting set to `yes`. You can do this by running `./show-phone.sh --settings`.
